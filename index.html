    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      AGGS was formed in 1994 with local Allen Gaels GAA club members being instrumental in starting this now long-established golf society. The society has evolved into a highly successful and enjoyable group for all involved. Many members come from the local area and wider community, with some traveling from various parts of the country. New members, young and old, are always welcome.

    <h2>Competitions & Awards</h2>
    <p>
      Initially, there was only one competition, the Golfer of the Year. Over time, the society has added others such as the Matchplay, High Handicap Golfer of the Year, and Ladies Golfer of the Year.

    <h2>Holidays & Outings</h2>
    <p>
      Since 1998, the society has traveled abroad for golf holidays and tours, visiting countries such as Tunisia, Spain, Portugal, South Africa, Dominican Republic, United States, Thailand, Tenerife, Argentina, Italy, and Turkey. In early June, members enjoy a 'mini-trip' to fine golf courses in Ireland with hotel stays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each year, the society plays around 8 competitive outings, with at least one new venue added regularly. The society has visited over 34 different courses in Ireland and more than 100 internationally.
